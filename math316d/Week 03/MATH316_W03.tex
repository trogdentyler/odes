\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Keep} but reword to: \textquotedblleft Using an Euler's Method approximation find y(.5) with the given differential equation y'= t, using a step size of h=0.1." The correct answer is $\implies$ $-1.0967$.
	\item \textbf{Keep} and please make sure the correct answer is $\implies$ $-.4431$.
	\item \textbf{Keep} but correct wording to, \textquotedblleft Plot the approximations from question 2 along with the analytic solution
to question 2's equation which is $y(t)=-\frac{1}{t}$." And please make sure the correct answer is, \textquotedblleft There is an obvious error between the approximations, but the graphs look similar."
	\item \textbf{Keep} the correct answer is $\implies$ $y(t)=2e^{t^{3}}$.
	\item \textbf{Keep} and please make sure the correct answered keyed $\implies$ \textbf{28.1 kg}.
